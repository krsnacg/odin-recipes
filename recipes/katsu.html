        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Katsu is a Japanese dish of crispy fried cutlets coated with Panko bread crumbs. 
            Popular varieties are chicken katsu (like this recipe) and tonkatsu (which is made with pork).
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredientes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Chicken: You'll need four skinless, boneless chicken breast halves.</li>
            <li>Seasonings: This chicken katsu recipe is simply seasoned with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Flour: All-purpose flour helps seal in the moisture, adds flavor, and promotes browning.</li>
            <li>Egg: An egg adds moisture and gives the Panko something to stick to.</li>
            <li>Panko: Panko bread crumbs are responsible for katsu's signature crunch.</li>
            <li>Oil: Opt for a neutral oil with a high smoke point, such as canola or vegetable oil.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Season chicken breasts on both sides with salt and pepper. Place flour, beaten egg, and panko crumbs into separate shallow dishes. Coat chicken breasts in flour, shaking off any excess; dip into egg, and then press into panko crumbs until well coated on both sides.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken in the hot oil, and fry until golden brown, 3 or 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.</li>
        </ol>
